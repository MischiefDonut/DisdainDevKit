Export process:

- Go into object mode
- Select the armature
- Be sure the current frame is at 1 (where the feet IK is correct and the feet are planted on to the floor)
- Add a new NLA track, name it to Action
- NLA - Bake action: all frames (0 to whatever the last frame is, frame step = 1) - untick all boxes EXCEPT Visual Keying. Bake Data set to Pose.
- Mute the other NLA tracks, leaving Action the only active one
- Push the newly created Action down
- On the Controller armature, set it to Pose Mode, then set the "Disable all constraints" bone's X to 1
- Select the armature, then the meshes, then export to IQM
- IQM export dialog: Animations: "Action", tick Meshes, Skeleton, Bounding Boxes. Materials set to "material"

Recommended not to save the Blender file beyond this point. But to undo everything and put the armature back in an editable state:

- Delete the Action strip and the Action track
- Unmute the original NLA track (the one with the original action clips intact)
- On the Controller armature, set it to Pose Mode, then select the "Disable all constraints" and reset its location (Alt G)
